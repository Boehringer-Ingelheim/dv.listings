Build a collection of named constants

Shiny uses strings as IDs to link UI and server elements. E.g:
foo_UI(id = ns("foo")) ...
foo_server(id = "foo")

This pattern makes it easy for programmers to fall on the trap of modifying one instance of the string literal "foo"
without modifying the rest and be unaware of the problem until a bug is hit. It's also easy to mistakes uses of "foo"
as an identifier from other uses (text labels, ...) when, as it's often the case, the parameter is not explicitly
named.
One easy fix consists in using global variables instead of plain string literals. In the case of the previous
example, that would mean:
ID_FOO <- "foo"
foo_UI(ns(ID_FOO)) ...
foo_server(ID_FOO)

That simple addition makes the purpose of ID_FOO clear and also fails gracefully when not all ID_FOO instances are
updated synchronously along a codebase. It has the drawback of polluting the global namespace with identifier
variables. That's easily solved by creating a container of constants, which is the purpose of this pack_of_constants
alias.
ID <- pack_of_constants(FOO = "foo", BAR = "bar")
ID$FOO
"foo"
ID$BA
Error in \verb{$.pack_of_constants}(ID, BA) :
Pack of constants "ID" does not contain "BA"

The pack of constants is a plain named list that enforces that all elements have unique, non-null names.
It is tagged as an S3 object to override its extraction operators.

The use of checkmate is unnecessary, but it's a Good Library(TM) and your module should rely on it anyways
